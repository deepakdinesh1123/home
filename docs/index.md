## My Expertise

- **Backend Development** — super comfortable with python frameworks such as Django, FastAPI but absolutely love creating my own framework by carefully selecting the kind of dependency I want for a particular thing in go (ex: using sqlc for queries and chi for routing)
- **Environment Management** — Utilizing nix and docker to create the most reproducible dev, test and deployment environments
- **CI/CD Pipelines** — Building efficient workflows for continuous integration, testing, benchmarking and application deployment
